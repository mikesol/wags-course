# Introduction

Hi!

I'm Mike, and I've built an online audio workstation called `wags`.

This is what it looks like.

And this is what it sounds like.

`wags` is much more than an audio workstation. It's music composition software, a tool for DJs, a synth builder, a way for people to jam together, a music streaming service and a way to explore ideas in functional programming. By the end of this course, you'll be making and sharing exciting new music that you would have never made before.

My background is in music technology, and I've used ProTools, Logic, Ableton Live, FL Studio, Ardor, Audacity, Max, PureData, SuperCollider, CSound, Faust, and tidal for various different projects. These are all amazing tools, but none of them quite fit the way I wanted to make music. I wrote `wags` to fill this gap,  and I've used it to make over three-hundred unique works with dozens of artists and musicians from all walks of life.

This course is for anyone interested in learning how to make music and how to program. While it will move fast, you'll need no prior knowledge in either music or programming to get started. All you'll need is a web browser.

So welcome! I'm looking forward to seeing you in the first lesson.
