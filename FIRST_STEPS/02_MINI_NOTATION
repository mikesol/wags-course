# Mini-notatoin

In our first lesson, we made a simple sampler. Let's recreate it real quick.

I'm going to navigate to `https://yap.wags.fm/p/mini-notation` and replace line 10 with `hh`. This is what it sounds like.

`hh` is one of hundreds of sounds bundled with wags. It comes from the SuperDirt sample library, an open-source library of really nice samples. To see the full list of available sounds, check out `https://github.com/mikesol/wagsi/blob/main/SOUNDS.md`.

For example, on this page there is a tabla sound. Let's listen to it.

Now, let's listen to some of the other tabla sounds.

There's also a nice glitch library.

And there's some fun synthetic vocals as well.
