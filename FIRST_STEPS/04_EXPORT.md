# Export

Hi all! In this lesson, we'll go over how to export your pad.

I'll navigate to a pad called export and, before I click play, I'll clik the round export button. Once it turns red, you're next sessions will export to a file. Note that you cannot start an export while your wag is playing. Exports needs to be started and stopped when playback is stopped.

So I'll start playback, jam a bit, and stop playback.

Now, we can see that a URL has come up in the chat window. If I paste that URL into my browser, we'll hear our jam.

The file is an ogg file, so if you download it, make sure to add an ogg extension. For example, if you're using curl, you can do `curl -o myfile.ogg` followed by the url. Then, if you open `myfile.ogg` with a media player like VLC, it will play back. You can also upload this file to your favorite streaming platform, like SoundCloud, or import it into Ableton or ProTools for further processing.

If I go back to my pad and play again, I'll get another file.

If I want exports to stop, I can press the red button and it will stop exporting.

While exporting files is useful in certain contexts, I actually don't do it all that much. Given the choice between exporting my file and sending someone the URL of my pad, I'd much rather send them my pad. Folks can play it, fork it, or modify directly. I find this way of sharing music much more satisfying than posting a file on SoundCloud or Spotify.

That being said, every tool has its strengths, and conventional DAWs provide certain advantages that wags either does not have yet or will never have by design. One great workflow is to create something in `wags`, import it into your favorite DAW, tweak it, and perhaps bring it back into wags for further processing.

Now that we've done our first export, in the next lesson, it's time to start tweaking some classic parameters like volume and playback speed. See you there!
