# Hello Sampler

Hi!

In this lesson, we're going to make a simple sampler.

I'll do this by navigating to the page `https://yap.wags.fm/p/hello-sampler`.

As you follow the course, you'll want to create your own pages. You can do this by coming up with a unique URL. For example, if your name is Justine, you could go to `https://yap.wags.fm/p/hello-sampler-justine`. If your name is Tyrel, you could go to `https://yap.wags.fm/p/hello-sampler-tyrel`.

If someone has already started work on a URL, you'll know because the text will be hilighted. For example, on my own pad, `https://yap.wags.fm/p/mike`, you'll see lots of different colors and edits. While you can work on and edit any URL following this scheme, please use good judgement about what to modify and what to leave alone.

ISo I'm back on `https://yap.wags.fm/p/hello-sampler`, and I'm going to press play.

And there you go! We have our first sampler.

Of course I'm cheating a bit, as the default document _is_ a sampler. So we'll modify just a bit, making it simpler. Let's delete the text here and replace it with `hh`. `hh` is a hi-hat sound from the open-source SuperDirt library.

So that's our first sampler! It's a single hi-hat, but hey, you gotta start somewhere! In the next lesson, we'll expand on this hi-hat using a system called mini-notation. See you there!
