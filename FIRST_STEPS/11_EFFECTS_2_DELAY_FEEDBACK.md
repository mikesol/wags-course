# Effects Part 2: Delay and feedback

In the last section, we went over filterrs and reverb. Wags is a full-featured DAW, so you can do nearly anything that you can do in GarageBand or Ableton. In this section, we'll look how to create a flange with variable delay, how to create a feedback loop, and how to pan the sound. I'll also let you know where the documentation for all this lives so you can discover what effects are available and how you can import your own custom effects.
